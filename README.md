## About SEO

I have installed Yoast SEO extension in order to add meta tags for the page. For the optimization in the furture, Schema Markup and Sitemap. Add/link google reviews or other trustful social media accounts is a good idea to keep this page up to date. Build backlinks as much as possible to this site will also be helpful to the SEO.
